NAME
    mail - read your mail messages

SYNOPSIS
    mail

DESCRIPTION
    mail shows the contents of your mail spool, then clears it.

EXAMPLES
    mail
        Show current messages and clear the spool.

SECURITY
    Messages are sent based on user name, which is trivial to spoof. An attacker
    logging in with another user's name can read their mail or send messages to other
    users using their name.
    Messages are stored unencrypted and can be accessed by the system operator.
