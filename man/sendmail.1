SENDMAIL(1)                            Manual pages                             SENDMAIL(1)

NAME
    sendmail - send mail to other users

SYNOPSIS
    sendmail <recipient> <message>

DESCRIPTION
    sendmail sends a mail message to the specified recipient user, who can
    in turn view it later using the mail(1) command. The recipient user does
    not need to be online to send a message; the next time they log on they
    will be notified of your message.

EXAMPLES
    sendmail k6av Hello, world!
        Send the message "Hello, world!" to user "k6av".

    sendmail laws\ of\ physics Hello, world!
        Send the message "Hello, world!" to user "laws of physics".

SECURITY
    Messages are sent based on user name, which is trivial to spoof. An attacker
    logging in with another user's name can read their mail or send messages to other
    users using their name.
    Messages are stored unencrypted and can be accessed by the system operator.
